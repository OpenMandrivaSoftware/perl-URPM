2007-08-28 14:12  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* : ensure #31969 doesn't occur anymore. if somethings goes wrong:
	  - display error message
	  - then default to one big transaction
	  
	  also display error message "using one big transaction" in the old
	  check (which
	  i don't really know what it does)

2007-08-28 13:54  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* : - build_transaction_set: new sort algorithm which allow
	  returning sets of
	  circular dependent packages, taking into account obsoleted
	  packages
	  (fixes #31969). It may still fail in presence of conflicts
	  
	  a better fix would be to make ->resolve_requested__no_suggests
	  handle
	  obsolete. ie:
	  - a requires b : bb or b
	  - bb requires c-1
	  - b requires c-2
	  - b obsoletes bb
	  => with a, bb and c-1 installed, "urpmi c" should upgrade bb into
	  b instead of
	  removing a and bb.

2007-08-28 11:03  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* : - spec2srcheader: workaround parseSpec returning a header where
	  ->arch is set

	  .src.rpm
	  (see #32824)

2007-08-24 12:01  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* : - fix split_length > 1
	  (eg: "urpmi --split-length 2 a b c" will only install 2 pkgs)
	  (this bug has not been reported, just discovered it while reading

	  rpmlib don't
	  timeout too quickly (and fd->rd_timeoutsecs is rpmlib internal
	  only, so we
	  can't hint it from here. in any case 1sec timeout is really too

	* URPM.pm, URPM/Resolve.pm: strict-arch should not imply that
	  noarch can't upgrade the real arch (#22558)

2006-11-21 07:59  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* ChangeLog: - default to strict-arch on 64bits (tvignaud)
	  - handle empty hdlist.cz/synthesis.cz (in build_hdlist,
	  build_synthesis, parse_hdlist, parse_synthesis)
	  - parse_rpms_build_headers: allow asking for packing (and so
	  fixing an error in urpmi)
	  - documentation & comments enhancement
	  - release 1.48

2006-11-21 07:54  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	  packing (fixes an error in urpmi)

2006-11-17 16:43  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* t/parse.t: add some tests on empty header, buggy header, empty
	  hdlist

2006-11-17 16:42  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* URPM.xs: at least one good header is needed for non compressed
	  hdlist and non empty file
	* URPM/Build.pm: allow building empty hdlist & synthesis

2006-11-17 16:25  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* URPM.xs, t/parse.t: - parse_hdlist on a simple header was broken
	  because pid was left unset,
	  - add some tests for this

2006-11-15 12:21  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* t/rpmdb.t: do display on which pkgs the 2 sorted lists disagree

2006-11-15 11:14  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* URPM.xs: parse_synthesis, parse_hdlist: handle gzip error status
	  instead of relying on
	  wether we did read at least one header. This allow "empty"
	  hdlist/synthesis.
	  But it means it is getting stricter, and the headers added to
	  {depslist} would
	  need to be removed if an error occured. Alas i don't know how to
	  do it (a
	  simple splice) in XS. If no better solution, i'll create a
	  wrapper function in
	  perl.

2006-11-10 14:18  Pixel <pixel at mandriva.com>

	* URPM/Build.pm: use the documented way to call ->parse_hdlist,
	  not the deprecated one

2006-06-01 11:47  Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgarciasuarez at mandriva.com>

	* Makefile.PL, URPM.xs: It's nice to be able to compile with rpm
	  4.4.6, but it's nice to be able to

2006-03-03 09:26  Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgarciasuarez at mandriva.com>

	* URPM.xs: Use a smaller buffer for the return value of
