- speedup is_arch_compat (7 times faster) by keeping the platform in a cache
- do not propose packages for non installed locales
- pass the prefered choices to {callback_choices}: this allows urpmi to select
  all the prefered packages according to installed locales

Version 1.80 - 3 September 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- fix bug in sort_graph (used by build_transaction_set)

Version 1.78 - 31 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- fix dead-loop in build_transaction_set (#33020)

Version 1.77 - 29 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- disable "dropping tags from rpm header" until we can safely use it

Version 1.76 - 28 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- build_transaction_set: new sort algorithm which allow returning sets of
  circular dependent packages, taking into account obsoleted packages
  (fixes #31969). It may still fail in presence of conflicts
- allow running transaction with justdb option
- fix split_length > 1 
  (eg: "urpmi --split-length 2 a b c" will only install 2 pkgs)
- spec2srcheader: workaround parseSpec returning a header where ->arch is set
  to %{_target_cpu} whereas we really want a header similar to .src.rpm
  (see #32824)

Version 1.75 - 12 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- fix dropping tags from rpm header.
  it hasn't work since MDK8.1 and rpm 4.0. 
  it may break urpmi!! but potentially allows a much smaller hdlist.cz :)

Version 1.74 - 12 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- sort choices per media, then per version

Version 1.73 - 11 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- allow running transaction with replagekgs option

Version 1.72 - 10 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- modify parse_hdlist so that partial hdlist reading can be used
  (needed when some stuff is already done in the callback)

Version 1.71 - 9 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- compilation fixes on rpm < 4.4.8

Version 1.69 - 9 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- "suggests" are no more handled as "requires"
- resolve_requested support "suggests": a newly suggested package is installed
  as if required (can be disabled with option no_suggests)

Version 1.68 - 3 August 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- add $trans->Element_version and $trans->Element_release

Version 1.67 - 22 June 2007, by Olivier "Nanar" Thauvin

- add osscore, archscore and platformscore function to URPM
- is_platform_compat function to Pkg object
- fix call to rpm function in spec2header()
- fix some compilation warnings

Version 1.66 - 2 July 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- fix --auto-select skipping some packages because of other packages providing
  a more recent version, but no obsolete between those packages.
  the fix is to revert commit from Aug 2002:
    "fixed propable old package (according provides) requested by
     request_packages_to_upgrade."

Version 1.65 - 22 June 2007, by Olivier Thauvin

- really fix arch_score evaluation

Version 1.64 - 12 June 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- hack on $pkg->is_arch_compat to make it return true for noarch packages
  when using rpm 4.4.8 (#31314)

Version 1.63 - 9 May 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- add $trans->Element_fullname

Version 1.62 - 3 May 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- pass the virtual package name as a parameter to {callback_choices} in
  ->resolve_requested
- add $trans->NElements and $trans->Element_name
  to be able to display name of uninstalled package in callback_uninst
- fix b--obsoletes-->a and c--conflicts-->a prompting for upgrading a
  (need a fix in urpmi which rely on the $state->{rejected} 
   to upgrade (-U) b instead of installing (-i) it)

Version 1.60 - 8 March 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- more debugging hooks
- create $urpm->packages_providing($name) and use it
- create $urpm->packages_by_name($name)

Version 1.59 - 1 March 2007, by Olivier Thauvin

- rpm 4.4.8 adaptions
- load rpm config files at module load, improve the mechanism

Version 1.58 - 14 February 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- don't check signature and digest in ->traverse and ->traverse_tag
  (=> x15 speedup, ie 2.5 speedup on urpmi --auto-select and rpmdrake)

Version 1.57 - 9 February 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- allow upgrading from noarch to x86_64 even if strict-arch

Version 1.56 - 19 January 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- tell perl that strings from rpm headers are utf8
- add URPM::bind_rpm_textdomain_codeset() to set encoding of messages returned
  by rpmlib, and tell perl that those strings are utf8
- really use strict-arch by default on x86_64

Version 1.55 - 10 January 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- bug fix release
- fix "not selecting foo-1 since the more recent foo-1 is installed" causing
  urpmi to try to remove the package it wants to install (#28076)

Version 1.54 - 9 January 2007, by Pascal "Pixel" Rigaux

- if we have a choice between foo-1 and bar-1 and foo-2 is installed,
  prefering bar-1 instead of foo-1
  (otherwise we can hit: "the more recent foo-2 is installed, but does not
  provide xxx whereas foo-1 does", cf bug #27991)
- bar is needed, foo-1 does provide bar, installed foo-2 does not provide bar:
  do not let the algorithm use foo-2 as if it also provides bar
- allow understanding what ->resolve_requested is doing through a callback ($urpm->{debug_URPM})
- cleanup some code in ->resolve_requested
- make the documentation for ->is_arch_compat more clear
